Patience, this page is a work in progress


My notes below


## Installing the software
Real struggle TT



## Ideation
To find a pattern, I started by listing random things I liked.
Snowflakes
Constellations
Hibiscus & fleur de frangipanier
Mandalas, motifs asiatiques
Moon and star
Shuriken en origami
Puzzle pieces
Forme logo paramètres
Kaleidoscope

## Getting familiar with the software & first prints
I first tried a simple shape to get acquainted with the software. I followed an online tutorial //put link here//

During the design of the piece, I 
but forgot to transfer that new file to the SD card so I printed the wrong file.
Mistaken the width so 2mm
This lead to a curving problem. I had to stop the print a bit before the end.


Tried again with a second design and a thiner width it was 0.3 mm but I find it a bit too thin. Add 1 or 2 mm.

More testing with smileys

After looking up some pictures for all of them, I went with the one that inspired me the most: snowflakes.
Initial design of the snowflake

After trial, I decided to do multiple snowflake designs.

Took inspiration from flowers too for the final designs

I printed snowflakes of multiple sizes. 5.5cm, 8cm and 9 cm. The ones that came out the best were the small ones. After a few prints witht different parameters. first layer 3mm + 1.5mm, first layer 2mm + 1.5mm, first layer 1mm + 1.5mm. The big ones were a fail but good news, the clipsing stuff works fine! I decided to shrink my desing and only do small snowflakes. Did a test to see if it still clips when resized and if it does I will launch mass production.
