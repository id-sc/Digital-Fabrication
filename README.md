## Getting familiar with the software & first prints
first test to get acquainted with the software
Mistaken the width so I had a curving problem and had to stop the print a bit before the end 2mm

Tried again with a second design and a thiner width it was 0.3 mm but I find it a bit too thin. Add 1 or 2 mm.

More testing with smileys

After looking up some pictures for all of them, I went with the one that inspired me the most: snowflakes.
Initial design of the snowflake

After trial, I decided to do multiple snowflake designs.

Took inspiration from flowers too for the final designs

I printed snowflakes of multiple sizes. 5.5cm, 8cm and 9 cm. The ones that came out the best were the small ones. After a few prints witht different parameters. first layer 3mm + 1.5mm, first layer 2mm + 1.5mm, first layer 1mm + 1.5mm. The big ones were a fail. I decided to shrink my desing and only do small snowflakes.
